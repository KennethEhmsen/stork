# Stork
A small footprint scripting language with C++ integration.

In this branch, the working tokenizer is implemented. You can compile this code and then execute it.
Each line you write on input will be tokenized and all tokens will be printed on the output.

This project is a work in progress. It is tested under Xcode on Mac. You should be able to compile it with C++17 standard on any platform.
